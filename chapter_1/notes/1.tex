\documentclass{article}     \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}     \begin{document}     When reading this book, just keep in mind that specific implementations of system change over time, but the underlying concepts do not. All computer systems have similar hardware and software components that perform similar functions.\As I recommend, you don't need to be an experienced software engineer when you start to read this book. However, the more experience you have, the efficiently you will learn. The writer of this article is still an college student. I have very naive concept and very little experience. It will be very kind of you if you contact me when you find something wrong. I really hope you can forgive me.\Best regards!     \end{document}
